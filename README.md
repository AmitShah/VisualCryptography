#This file takes one argument which is a file that you would like to split into two encrypted images.
#The original image can only be viewed by overlaying the two encrypted images.
#If printed on clear plastic, It can be very finicky to align the two images if the pixel count is too high.
#For best results keep the original image below 200x200 pixels and print as large as possible onto clear plastic to
# obtain the best results.

#You can go to higher resolutions but you then really have to be precise when aligning the two images.

#The resulting images will be twice as wide and twice as tall pixelwise and there is only 1 bit colour.#Copyright, Robert Donovan, LessonStudio, 2014

#Future features should include alignment marks to make aligning the two transparancies easier.

#Maybe I will increase the efficiency of the conversion except that I find that I spend more prep time in
# photoshop by many orders of magnitude than any time savings that could be extracted.

#The reason I built this is that I found many tools out there for doing this that didn't work for a
# variety of reasons including being built for long dead versions of Python or PIL.
